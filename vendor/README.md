# Vendor Directory Placeholder

The Composer dependencies for this project must be built once in an environment
with internet access and committed (or archived) alongside the repository.

Because this workspace does not have external network access, the actual
`vendor/` contents cannot be generated here. Replace this placeholder with the
pre-built `vendor/` tree before building or running the containers.
